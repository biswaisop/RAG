# Feature Engineering

Feature Engineering is the art of creating better inputs for ML models.
In this notebook (4-feature_engineering.ipynb), we will:

- Encoding categorical variables (OneHot, Label Encoding)
- Normalization and Standardization
- Binning numerical variables
- Feature selection techniques
- Creating interaction features

Better features = Smarter models.
