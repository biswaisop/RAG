# Model Evaluation

The last step in the ML pipeline is model evaluation.
In this notebook (6-model_evaluation.ipynb), we will cover:

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC curves
- Confusion Matrix
- Bias-variance tradeoff
- Model interpretability with SHAP/feature importance

Evaluation ensures that our model is reliable and ready for deployment.
